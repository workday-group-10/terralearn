## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Our demo on demo day went really well! We were able to keep the crowd engaged during our presentation even though we went last.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 The day before demo day, our website completely stopped working. Components that had never given us problems in the past were starting to crash on us, and since Folasade was at home and Evans and Andrew were in person in made communicating more difficult.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished nearly everything in our sprint plan, the only thing we were not able to implement was the difficulty feature, due to the unforseen circumstances our team had.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 Since we spent this week mainly cleaning up and making sure everything we've implemented was working properly, we did not use many, if any, resources this week.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 The feature that we did not end up completing was the difficulty feature, but at the end of the day we have a great, fully functioning project and that is something to be proud of.
