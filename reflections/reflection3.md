## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Deploying our project!!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Having one less day to work, deploying the website was an all day affair, and just lack of time.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

No, due to us having one less day, we were not able to finish everything on time. However, some of us will be working over the weekend and will hopefully be able to finish the tasks then. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The demos given by other students on how to deploy we were helpful, unforuntately the resources given by Codepath alone were sometimes not very detailed which was tricky when we ran into errors.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

A feature that remains at risk is unforutunately our hint feature. It would require a lot of manual work to get adequate hints unfortunately, which is the main problem we are running into for this feature.
