## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 Getting the street view google map api implemented.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Accessing coordinates from different marker locations, merge conflicts, git in general, a lot of styling issues.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We overestimated how much we can get done in a week, due to the complexity of the APIs we are working with. We are planning on prioritzing making our project function fully, rather than worrying about small styling mistakes. 

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

I would say pull request demo was helpful in getting us used to working as a team on github. However, I will say we personally spent a lot of time researching for our own resources, due to some instructions being vague on the course portal.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 A feature we are featuring to be "at risk" is the difficulty feature that would allow users to choose the difficulty of the game they are playing. It would require a lot of more critical thinking with the API, so it may become a stretch feature if we complete all other user stories/features.
