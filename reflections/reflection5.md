## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast)

The pacing was just right, we were given a good amount of time to plan and develop the vision we had for our project, it was just right.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?

It changed a lot given some stretch features that was pitched and suggestions that were given, we would go about to be more efficent in planning if we were ti start over in this project.

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?

They were incredibly helpful in preperation for our capstone project. Using the student store really helped see how a full website is put together and the lifetracker and bank labs really helped how to create and use a backend in projects.

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)

Everyone was helpful. the constant feedback and tips and suggestions were critical to our success.
