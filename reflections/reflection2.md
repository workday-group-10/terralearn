## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Completing our Minimum Viable Product.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We faced a lot of merge conflicts, connecting the favorites and guesses was a huge challenge, and the MediaWiki API was difficult to work with at times.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We did finish all of our taks in our sprint plan for the week, because we finished our MVP right on time.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

For this week in particular, due to the knowledge we've gotten from our first week of the program, we did not need to rely super heavily on resources provided by Codepath in particular. We would check Stack Overflow for some errors every once and a while, but a lot of the tasks we did this week depended on our personal trials and errors.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

Again the feature/user story we consider the most "at risk", is our difficulty levels user story. It would be difficult to change the amount of the Google Street View API a user can see, and we may have to scrap that user story compeletely if time does not allow for it.
