## Problem Statement and Description

World geography is not being taught at a lot of schools, and our project can give students the opportunity to learn more about geography in a fun way.
Our project is a game where the user is given a street view of a random place in the world, and they have to guess where it is located. As they guess they can learn more about the place they are guessing about and more. Our targeted audience will use our website as an opportunity to learn and have fun.
