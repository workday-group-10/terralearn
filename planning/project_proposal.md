# Project Proposal

Pod Members: Andrew Valerio, Evans Asuboah, Folasade Oloye

## Problem Statement

World geography is not being taught at a lot of schools, and our project can give students the opportunity to learn more about geography in a fun way.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

Our project is a game where the user is given a street view of a random place in the world, and they have to guess where it is located. As they guess they can learn more about the place they are guessing about and more. Our targeted audience will use our website as an opportunity to learn and have fun.


## Expected Features List

Add a list of your groups's brainstormed features list

-Different levels of difficulty the user could chose about
-Login In to play
-Maybe a leadership board
-After someone guesses a location, we give them the correct answer and they will get a little lesson about the area

## Related Work

What similar apps and websites? How will your project stand out from these other websites?

This would be similar to the GeoGuessr website, but it would stand out as GeoGuessr has some aspects behind a paywall, and ours would also be teaching people about the areas they are guessing about.

## Open Questions

What questions do you still have? What topics do you need to research more for your project?

We defintely need to look more into the the google maps api and how we are going to work with it. We also need to look into some geography apis and such so that we can get the proper information we need about the areas someone's guessing about.
